# FilMoreBlanks
## CSV File fill-in-the-blank Editor

FilMoreBlanks take a CSV and parses it for a specific string and fills that value with a chosen value. This works from 1:1 to 1:many value swaps.

## Getting started
- Place the CSV in the project dir 
- fill out the config.yaml file that is located in the examples folder
- run the script using the quick start below
- POOF ðŸ’¨
- you have a CSV that's just that much more useful to you 

## Files being moved
- processed files will move to the filled_files dir (Will be created in project path)
- the CSV used in the script will be moved to the archived dir (Will be created in project path)
- during processing the CSV file will be moved from the top project path to the digest dir (Will be created in project path)
- Config file will be moved to FilMoreBlanks_Configs (Will be created in project path)


## Quick Start
```bash
# move the config file to the project dir when running (recommended)
python3 basic_access.py -config_file config.yaml
```

## using as a import
when using as an import it will only return the object and no config files are needed since it interacts with the main function directly.
```bash
pip install FilMoreBlanks
```

```python
from blanket_fill import BlanketFill

bf = BlanketFill('test_csv.csv')
atc = ('new servers',['5,5,5,5','2.2.2.2','7,7,7,7'])
atc_2 = ('11.1.0.0/16',['233.31.244.39','100.19.68.193','235.253.243.128','232.151.66.30','74.22.1.140'])
atc_3 = ('169.156.158.231',['111.254.29.134','96.20.144.254'])
bf.populate_csv(atc)
bf.populate_csv(atc_2)
bf.populate_csv(atc_3,['source'])
# the resultant PD
res = bf.csv_data
```
